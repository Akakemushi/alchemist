About The Inventory Tab: 
In this area, players will have two big scrollable lists, one for reagents (which is what potion ingredients are called), 
and one for completed potions. Each item on the list will of course show the name, how many of the item the player possesses, and perhaps 2 or 3 
other short bits of information about that item. Players should be able to "use" their potions from this tab. 

About the Foraging Tab 
In this tab, players can set up a "search plan" and send it to the DM for approval. The search plan will tell the DM: 
-who is searching (the player making the request) 
-how many hours they are searching for in game time 
-the biome or biomes in which they want to search 
-and an optional 4th part, a "target reagent". If not given, it assumes that the player is just searching for alchemical reagents in general, not 
anything in particular. (This matters because it will affect the outcome of the foraging. Searching for something specific will have a higher 
likelihood of finding what you're looking for, but at the expense of missing other potential reagents) 

The DM, who will presumably know how much time the players have in game to explore and also what type of terrain they are in, can either approve 
or deny search requests. This prevents players from abusing the system by just spamming the search function until they finally find hundreds or 
even thousands of reagents. I may want to add a feature later where the DM can secretly give bonuses or penalties to the requests upon approval, 
but at first, just a simple approve or deny is enough. I think that a list of foraging events should be on this tab, with approved (but yet to be 
executed) searches at the top, and then everything else in chronological order from newest to oldest. There will be a button that says 
"Begin Foraging" or something, that is grayed-out and unclickable at first, but becomes "active" and clickable once approval is received. 
At this point, all the player needs to do is press the button and the system springs into action, rolling up random reagents (and many red 
herrings as well) that can potentially be found, rolling search checks for the player, and recording their results. Of course the Player's 
modifiers for stats and skills will already be in the system. Anything found will automatically be transferred into the Player's inventory tab, 
and if it is something that they have encountered before (or otherwise have knowledge of according to what's in the Knowledge Tab), it will 
automatically be labeled accordingly. Otherwise only a brief description will be provided of the unknown reagents (and false positives). 

About the Laboratory Tab
In this tab, Players can see their current stockpile of "Storgstrum's Brew". 
This is an item (and also game mechanic) that I invented for the purposes of this app. It is a liquid, usually stored in barrels or other such 
receptacles, that is to alchemy what litmus paper is to chemistry. It has one primary use: to determine the "potency" of a reagent. 
Storgstrum's Brew (hereafter called "SB" for short) is mixed with a reagent (or potential reagent), and slowly stirred and heated using 
increasingly hotter and hotter candles (called Lodrick Candles). The reaction (if any) that results tells the Player that reagent's "potency value" 
(hereafter called "PV"). There is a lot of "flavor text" that I have put into this area, describing what each of the reactions look like, however 
for programming purposes, PV is simply a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being the weakest reagent, and 10 being the strongest. No reaction means that 
the player has found a red herring that basically looks cool but is worthless for alchemy. Even though SB is a liquid, I do not intend to make 
things complicated by keeping track of ounces or milliliters. Instead, there is simply a "set" amount of SB that is required for any potency test, 
and the amount of the liquid available to the Player can simply be given as an integer representing how many potency tests they can perform with 
the amount they have left. Simple. It should also be noted that by mixing any reagent with SB, it completely ruins that reagent. So Players gain 
knowledge at the cost of a reagent. Of course, Players could technically just try mixing things they foraged without knowing their potency or if 
they are even alchemical at all, but that also runs the risk of just wasting reagents. A successful reaction will automatically update the Player's 
Knowledge tab, effectively "unlocking" it, and adding the name, UNREFINED PV (explained later), physical description, and biome found. Naturally, 
once "dose" of SB and the reagent will be used up in the process, and their inventory will be updated automatically accordingly. In the case of 
"no reaction" or "dud", then the dose of SB is expended, and that reagent and any copies of it in their inventory will be removed automatically. 
Note that copies of "duds" will always come from the same foraging event, as various types of duds/red herrings are NOT stored in the database, 
their descriptions will be generated randomly by an elaborate text generator. If it ever occurs that two duds from completely different foraging 
events share the exact same descriptive text, it is a coincidence and just a fluke. The next thing that can be done in the laboratory is 
refinement. Every single reagent has 2 PVs, the UPV (unrefined potency value) and the RPV (refined potency value). This is basically the same 
as comparing raw vanilla to vanilla extract. By spending some time and making an alchemy check against a DC based on the DC of that specific 
reagent, a player can attempt to raise the PV of one dose of a particular reagent that they have. Failure means they destroy that dose of the 
reagent and the time is wasted, success will remove one dose of the UPV reagent from their inventory, and add one dose of that reagent with its 
RPV value (however the exact RPV will not be immediately written unless it, too, has been tested with SB. Otherwise their Knowledge and Inventory 
will simply show question marks for the RPV column ??). The final thing they can do in the laboratory is attempt to mix two reagents together and 
hope that it produces a functional potion. The mechanics are based on how potion mixing works in Skyrim, with a few tweaks. There is a big list of 
effects that I have for potions. Each effect has a strength associated with it from 1 to 10, just like the PVs. Weak potions may only grant a small 
bonus for a single turn, while the most powerful potions (which are incredibly rare and hard to make) can potentially grant permanent, 
character-altering effects. There are many effect types, but for a few examples, there are potions of defense, potions of fire resistance, 
potions of flight, potions of invisibility, potions of water-breathing and so on. For your reference, there are currently 44 different effect 
types, each with strengths ranging from 1 to 10, for a total of 440 different possible potions. Unless the Player has acquired some sort of item 
like a textbook or someone's research notes, they start with no knowledge of what effect types a reagent is associated with. Each reagent is 
associated with 4 different effect types. If two different reagents that share at least one effect type are mixed, it produces a functional potion 
that produces that effect type when imbibed (or in some cases, when splashed onto an enemy). The strength of the potion is the average of the two 
reagents PVs used to make it, rounded down (so if something with a UPV of 3 and something else with an RPV of 8 share an effect type and are mixed, 
it would produce a potion of that effect type, strength 5). If two reagents which do NOT share ANY effect types are mixed, they are both ruined in 
the process, BUT, the failure is NOT revealed to the player just yet (see below). In the event a functional potion is produced, the Player still 
doesn't know it until either they or someone else drinks it. Up until that point, the potion will simply be listed as "Unknown Potion", and in the 
Knowledge Tab, the reagents 4 associated effect types will all be blank or question marks. Once they click the "Use" button on the inventory menu 
for an unknown potion, the system will immediately let them know what happened. If there was an effect, then that effect type will be "unlocked" 
for both of the reagents used to make it and revealed in the Knowledge tab. If the potion was a dud, then nothing happens, and a pop up will ask 
the player if they would like to discard all copies of that dud (that is to say, potions that used the same two reagents). I am not sure just yet 
on how best to keep track of failed experiments in the database, but I think the most user-friendly route on the front-end would be to have two 
drop-down selection menus for selecting what you want to mix, and upon selecting the FIRST one, the second list is automatically filtered using 
JavaScript to remove any ingredients that have been mixed with the first one before and failed.

FORAGING MECHANICS
First, determine what type of environment the characters are in, and roll the appropriate dice on the table below to determine the base number 
of "potential" reagents there are in the searchable vicinity. (DM secret roll) 
High Mountains = 1d6 Potentials 
Temperate Plains/Hills = 1d10 Potentials 
Swamps & Cemeteries = 1d8 Potentials 
Deserts = 1d6 Potentials 
Temperate Forests = 1d12 Potentials 
Tropical Areas & Jungles = 1d12 Potentials 
Volcanic & Wasteland = 1d8 Potentials 
Underground & Caves = 1d6 Potentials 
Aquatic/Ocean = 1d6 Potentials 
Cold Tundra = 1d5 Potentials 
Urban & Settlements = 1d4 Potentials 

Next, roll Nature or Alchemy checks for the players to see how well they've chosen their searching location. A better roll means they know the 
more likely places for alchemical ingredients. If they are searching for a known ingredient, they get a +5 to this roll, but will neglect 
searching for anything else. 

After that, add a number of Bonus potentials to the base number of potentials according to the following chart, depending on what their skill 
check result was. The check result also affects the chance that the "potential" reagent is an "actual" reagent, and not just a dud. 
Bonus Potentials and Real Reagent chance on a check result of: 
0-19 +0 20% 
20-24 +1 30% 
25-29 +2 40% 
30-34 +3 45% 
35-39 +4 50% 
40-44 +5 60% 
45-49 +6 65% 
50+ +7 70% 

So as you can see, higher level and more experienced alchemists will not only be able to spot more potential reagents, but their accuracy at 
differentiating between true reagents and things that just "look cool" is much higher. Roll once for each potential reagent in the vicinity, 
using the percentage derived from the check result, to see if each potential reagent is a true reagent or a dud, and record the results. This 
generates the actual number of reagents and duds the player(s) could find in the area. 

Next, roll the rarity of each true reagent randomly on a d10. A result of 1-7 means it is common, 8 or 9 is uncommon, and 10 is rare. 
Roll on the random tables for common, uncommon, and rare reagents for the biome being explored to generate the specific reagents that are in 
the vicinity. Look up each reagent, and note its Search DC and Physical Description, note it, and then roll the cluster dice for each real 
reagent and note how many doses can be recovered if it is found. Non-alchemical duds should also be given a cluster quantity and description for 
flavor and to keep the players interested and guessing. For each dud cluster, either roll 1d4 or 1d6 (chosen randomly). Now that the search DCs 
are known for the real reagents, make fake perception DCs for the duds using the following formula: 10 + half player's level + 1d10. Finally, have 
all players involved in the search make perception checks for each reagent in the vicinity to see if it is discovered and collected. Searching 
the entire area takes 1 hour for one person. If they rush, they take 30 minutes, but suffer a -5 penalty to all perception checks. Players looking 
for a known ingredient get a + 5 bonus to their perception (as noted earlier). The work can also be divided among multiple players to shorten the 
time needed, however only one PC may roll for each potential if this is done. On the other hand, if all players involved spend the full hour 
combing over the area, each player may roll for each potential reagent. This takes longer, but offers more thorough coverage. 

Example 1: 4 players split up to search the same area quickly, with 10 potentials in the area. 60 minutes divided by 4 means that the search only 
takes 15 minutes. However each potential only has one chance of being spotted. Player 1 rolls perception on 3 of them, Player 2 rolls perception 
on 3 more of them, Player 3 rolls perception on 2 of them, and Player 4 rolls perception on the last two. They may have missed several reagents, 
but they can instead move on to a new area to try again, (or perhaps that's all the time they had before an angry dragon arrives...) 

Example 2: 4 players take their time to thoroughly search the same area, with 10 potentials in the area. The search takes the full 60 minutes, 
but each potential has 4 chances of being spotted, since every player will make a perception check on every potential reagent. It's slow going, 
but gets results.
