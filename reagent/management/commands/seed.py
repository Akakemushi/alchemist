        # - Add the reagent's info to this list
        # - Decide which biomes it will appear in, and add the reagents name to the lists associated with those biomes in the biomes section.
        # - Decide which 4 potion effects it is associated with, and add the reagent's name to the lists associated with those potion effects in the potion effects section.

        # - rpv must be greater than upv
        # - if category.uses_cluster_dice is True (that is to say its "category" is anything other than "Carve") then cluster dice is required.
