CUSTOM DJANGO MANAGE.PY COMMANDS
--To make your own command line commands, first create a file structure as follows:
    mainapp
        management
            __init__.py
            commands
                __init__.py
                yourcustomcommand.py
--These folders (management and commands) must be used and can't be named anything else. You must initialize them with __init__.py
--The FILES inside of the commands folder become COMMANDS to be used after the manage.py  command.  For example, adding seed.py would allow you to DJANGO
        python manage.py seed          
--Then, to make your new command work, INSIDE the new custom command, you must import
    from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
--Without it, django will not recognize it as a command.
--Next, the command class itself is mandatory.  You MUST have:
    class Command(BaseCommand):
--No other way will work.
--You can then add a help line if you want (probably a good idea) by doing...
    class Command(BaseCommand):
        help = "Seed the database with initial Biomes, Reagents, and PotionEffects."
  ...or an explanation of whatever the command is going to do.
--About Flags:  Flags are optional arguments that you can add after the main command word.
--Short flags (aka short options) use one dash and one letter, such as -f, -s, -k etc...
--Long flags use two dashes and a word, such as --file --soup --krazy
--The only difference between them is long ones are more descriptive, so other devs can understand what the option does. Functionally they are the same.
--Note that in either case you MUST use the dashes.  To not do so results in a MANDATORY and POSITIONAL argument.
--To create a new flag, add a new function into the class like so:
    def add_arguments(self, parser):
        parser.add_argument(          <---teaches the parser how to recognize a new flag or argument.
            "--flush",                <---sets the name of your flag
            action="store_true",      <---MANDATORY.  Write exactly like this if you want the behavior to be either on or off.  What it does is sets options["flush"]=True when executing the code
            help="Delete existing PotionEffects, Biomes, and Reagents before seeding (DEV ONLY).",
        )
--Here, add_arguments()  is a RESERVED django word (it's only reserved in the context of defining django commands, but it's important if you want flags.)
--"parser" is an instance of    argparse.ArgumentParser.  Think of it as the object that knows how to interpret everything typed after "python manage.py mycommand"
--the order of the arguments given to parser.add_argument() MATTERS.  You must put all of your flag names BEFORE your keyword arguments (which are
    action, help, default, etc.)
--see the SEED tutorial section for more about --flush
--next you'll need...
    def handle(self, *args, **options):
  ... which is the HEART of the command.  This takes the options and arguments given from the command line and processes them.




SEED FILE RELATED STUFF
--First make a custom seed command using the tutorial written elsewhere in here.
--Then, you'll want to import
    from django.db import transaction
--This is a decorator that means "either everything in this code succeeds or NOTHING is written to the DB.  It's a safety measure, and very
    important when your DB contains many-to-many relationships
--Then import:
    from django.apps import apps
--Don't import the models directly like you normally would as it can lead to circular imports.  With "apps" imported, you can later do stuff like
        Reagent = apps.get_model("alchemist", "Reagent")
  so it will all work out in the end.
--In addition to other basic functions for creating custom commands, this one is necessary for seed commands...
    @transaction.atomic                         <---- add the decorator
    def handle(self, *args, **options):         <---- write the handler as normal.
--This is what prevents incomplete data from entering the DB.  If you're just reading data though you don't need it.
--Next import your models, such as...
    Reagent = apps.get_model("alchemist", "Reagent")
    Biome = apps.get_model("alchemist", "Biome")
    PotionEffect = apps.get_model("alchemist", "PotionEffect")
--Make sure the model names match exactly. Like, if you decide to rename a model later on, you have to change it here, too. Also, the first word is the app name "alchemist", not the folder name.
--Next, it's a good idea to implement a "flush" option for seeding, in case you want to completely redo your DB from scratch.
    if options["flush"]:
        PotionEffect.objects.all().delete()
        Biome.objects.all().delete()
        Reagent.objects.all().delete()
--MAKE SURE that you delete models in the right order!  If there are relationships, delete the "leaves" of the tree first, (nothing dependant
  on them), then the "branches" and then the "trunk".  (If all you have are two M2M models then it probably doesn't matter.)
--Next, create your data.  (this is the juicy part!)  Here's an example:
    reagent_seed = [
        {"name": "Mooncap Mushroom", "upv": 6, "rpv": 3},
        {"name": "Bog Lily", "upv": 4, "rpv": 5},
    ]
--Next write the code to add the seeds to the DB.
    reagents_by_name = {}                                              <--- this line used in the next step.
        for r in reagent_seed:
            reagent, created = Reagent.objects.update_or_create(       <--- update_or_create()  always returns a Tuple, consisting of (instance, boolean)  The boolean it True if a NEW thing was added to DB (newly created), and False if somethign was found and updated. (not created) 
                name=r["name"],                                        <--- IMPORTANT!  This attribute is OUTSIDE of "defaults{}", and therefore is used as the LOOKUP when seed runs.  It will NOT be updated.
                defaults={                                             <--- IMPORTANT!  Anything you WANT updated, you MUST put inside a hash called "defaults".
                    "upv": r["upv"],
                    "rpv": r["rpv"],
                },
            )
--by using  the .update_or_create()  method, you can update your DB with the seed command without duplicating everything in the DB.
--Next [BEST PRACTICE IF USING MANY-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIPS] track the names of the items being entered and make a hash/dict.
        reagents_by_name[reagent.name] = reagent
--Why? Later, we need actual model instances to set M2M relations, and looking them up repeatedly via DB would be slower and noisier. This acts as an in-memory lookup table.
--Next, if you're doing many-2-many, you need to create the relationships.  For example, you could do something like:
    biome_seed = {
        "Forest": ["Mooncap Mushroom", "Frost Thistle"],
    }
--This is very human-readable.
--Then you push them to the DB just like normal...
    biome, created = Biome.objects.update_or_create(
        name=biome_name,
        defaults={},                                       <--- you can add attributes later and it should be fine.
    )
--Validating references (VERY IMPORTANT)
    missing = [n for n in reagent_names if n not in reagents_by_name]
    if missing:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Biome '{biome_name}' references missing reagents: {missing}"
        )
--This is a guard rail. Without it: Typos silently fail, Biomes end up missing reagents, bugs appear later and are hard to trace.
--But with it, seeding fails loudly, you fix the seed data immediately.
